A repo that has the code for an SD Copier.

It runs on a RP2040 (currently using RP2040-LCP-0.96) with the Adafruit SDIO/+SPI SD card adapter.

The screen on RP2040-LCP-0.96 takes up some of the SPI pins, so if we stick with SPI we can't use this board (and its screen anyway).

Hoping to switch to SDIO anyway, and there is a chance the GPIOs will line up in a way that allows us to still use the screen. 
If not, it is not a big deal, we will just get a rp2040 board without a pre-installed screen and add a screen ourselves.
This might even be better anyway since we might want a different screen.
